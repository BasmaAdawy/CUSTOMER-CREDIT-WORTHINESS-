This project is for the Process Mining and Intelligence course in AIDE master degree in UNIPI
In this course we gain knowledge and experience essential for developing Process Intelligence (PI) systems. A PI system analyzes a business process or operational workflow, performs a data-driven modeling of complex organizations, with its abstractions and interfaces, its metrics. PI is a modern approach for setting up, simulating, performing, monitoring organization's processes, with goals such as improved productivity, reduced costs, increased agility, integration, interoperability and coordination between actors and systems involved. PI supports the way that machines, people, work, activities, events, tools are arranged by collaborating organizations for efficiently delivering goods and services. Students are trained on how to develop non-trivial process analysis.
and many softwares were used during the course in labs for better understanding process mining.

The project was done using different softwares even online on installed
from those softwares:
- Signavio
- Bimp
- Disco
- ProM
- Apromore
